### Special Note

Although `create-react-app` is a popular choice for bootstrapping React projects, our application leans on the speedy and efficient Vite.js. Yet, for those familiar with React workflows, the `npm start` command remains the gateway to launching the app.

## Functionalities

1. **Create Polls**: Users can formulate new polls with custom questions and options.
2. **Cast Votes**: Participate in polls and cast your vote for the desired options.
3. **View Results**: After voting, users can instantly view aggregated poll results.
4. **User Leaderboards**: The application features an interactive leaderboard where users can check rankings based on poll participation and influence.
5. **Responsive UI**: The app dynamically adjusts to user interactions, providing real-time feedback and updates.
